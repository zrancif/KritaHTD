**Krita: Hold to Draw like in MSPaint**

Don't wanna buy a drawing tablet?
    Find drawing tablet weird to use?
    Find that MSPaint hold-space-to-draw very handy?
    Don't wanna download app to do this like AutoHotkey?

  Here's my untitled tool to replicate the MSPaint hold-space-to-draw!
  Requirements: 
        Optional: Universal (non-bluetooth) Stylus / a DIY stylus  > recommended
        Touchpad (cuz u might wanna use that as a mini drawing tablet) / mouse
    
  How to use:
    1. Use touchpad/mouse as normal, but for convenience, hold (`) or (*) to draw like MSPaint's hold-space-to-draw

Instructions: 
    1. change the file extention from .txt to .cpp
    2. compile in any c++ compiler.
       Optional: Rename the compiled .exe file to any name (As long as you can find it easily)
    3. run the compiled .exe file 
    4. don't close the program until you're done with it.

Important Notes:
    1. Specifically made for Krita (window title = "Krita" on the window's top-left corner)
    2. Will not work on other apps

Notes:
    *I did this because I don't wanna download extra files for a simple function. So I made this small program as small as I possibly can.
    Yeah... That's why.*


**To Download (yes, no setup or installation**
Option 1:
1. download only the KritaHTD.exe and run.
2. That's it.
